# DCGAN-on-Anime-Faces
The respository contains the code for the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) trained on the anime faces dataset.  
  
There are two files:
- gan.py: It is used to train the DCGAN on the anime faces dataset.
- test.py: This file loads the saved generator model and generates some fake samples and save them with the name fake.png

## Dataset
Download the dataset and put all the images in the data folder.<br/>
